# Beautify Web - Chrome extensiom

Something about the fonts used in different websites bothered my eyes a bit. I wish browsers could override those beautiful and often times ugly fonts and use something default I prefer. So I built this extension to keep a consistent font across websites I visit. I am using the font Quicksand, its beautiful, elegant and readable.

Install the extension from here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/more-readable-web/cifmflhoahlbbjacnjhkhofjhcbadcmc
